Hi! My name is Daniel Falster. I am an ARC future fellow at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. I use a combination of maths, computer models, and large data sets to test fundamental ideas about the processes shaping biological communities. I am passionate about science, open data, reproducible research, and teaching biologists to code.

**Research questions**: The main focus in of my lab is predicting the distribution of plant types found within vegetation and across environmental gradients, from ecological and evolutionary first principles. More broadly, I am interested in understanding how competitive interactions shape the ecology, population dynamics, and traits of species and communities. The sorts of questions we address include:

- How does competition for light select for particular kinds of traits?
- How do trait-based trade-offs in plant function maintain functional diversity, enabling species to coexist even under competition?
- How do functional traits influence the growth and life cycle of plant species?

**Interested in PhD, Masters or Honours?** I am interested in supervising students seeking to apply quantitative methods to address the types of questions outlined above. If you are interested in joining the lab, please send a brief statement of research interests, along with a CV, to Daniel.
