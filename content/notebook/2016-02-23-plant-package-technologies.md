In [this post on the methods blog](https://methodsblog.wordpress.com/2016/02/23/plant/)
Rich FitzJohn and I describe the key technologies used to build our recently published package for R called [plant](https://github.com/traitecoevo/plant) -- an individual-based simulation model that simulates the growth of individual trees, stands of competing plants, or entire metacommunities under a disturbance regime, using common physiological rules and trait-based functional trade-offs to capture differences among species.
