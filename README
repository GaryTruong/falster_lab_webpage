# Source for Falster lab website

The website is developed using the [Hugo](https://hugodocs.info) static site generator and deployed on XXX. 

The site layout was originally forked from [Carl Boettiger's lab notebook](https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook) and then customised. Only general design features have been retained. I removed the history in this repo, both because of size and because I didn't want to redistribute content specific to Carl's lab, even in the history of a git repo.

The original content was distributed under a CC-BY licence, 
which I will also apply here. I acknowledge the efforts of Carl and other's before him in developing the templates I have used in this website. 

## Building site 

Download & install Hugo from https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases (NB, don't need Go to run Hugo)

To build site run 

```
hugo 
```

To view, run following, which will open a viewer on localhost:1313/

```
hugo server -D
```

## Short codes

[Hugo uses short codes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/
) to easily embed content.
